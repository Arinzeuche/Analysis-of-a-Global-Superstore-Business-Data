# Analysis-of-a-Global-Superstore-Business-Data
This project meticulously examined and analyzed data from a US-based superstore business spanning a 4-year fiscal period from 2014 to 2017. The analysis focused on the revenue and profitability generated by the business, as well as key operational processes such as customer locations, product segments including categories and sub-categories, and shipping modes. The objective of the analysis was to comprehend the business model and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that drive revenue and profits, and subsequently provide informed recommendations based on the data analysis and evaluation. These recommendations aimed to optimize business processes and enhance overall revenue and profits.

**Major insights from the analysis include**:

The Technology category generated the highest revenue and profits over the study period.
California was the most profitable state for the business, while New York generated the most revenue.
The business typically saw the highest revenue in November but the highest profits in December.
The analysis revealed that while products like bookcases and tables under the Furniture category generated more revenue, they often resulted in negative profit margins. This suggests a need for a more balanced approach to product selection and profitability optimization. The business model appears to require a focus on products that not only generate high revenue but also contribute positively to the bottom line.

In conclusion, the report highlights the importance of identifying and prioritizing profitable products to sustain and grow the business. It underscores the need for strategic product selection and operational improvements to enhance profitability and overall business performance
